===========

Getting trill commits from @packetfocus.

Adding a new line from d1stkfactory.

Adding a new line from scanner.

After reading RFC 3507, it didn't seem that hard to do this in Ruby. 

Simple to use, run `./setup.sh full` as root or sudo on Ubuntu 11.04+. It will install the needed packages, setup ruby, and other time consuming tasks.

After, check out the `setup/` directory for more information on getting Squid ready to use with echelon. Also check out `config/settings.yml` for more configuration information.

When you are ready, simply `ruby echelon.rb config/settings.yml`
